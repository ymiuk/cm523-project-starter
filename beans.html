      <h3 class="beanstype">Two types of coffee beans</h3>
      <div class="flex_container">
        <div class="flex_item"><span class="inner_text">Arabica:</span><br> The Arabica coffee bean is renowned globally
          as the most popular type of coffee. It is widely regarded as superior to Robusta due to its delicate taste and
          low acidity. Since Arabica is grown at higher elevations, it can be more challenging and expensive to
          cultivate. Despite being labor-intensive and yielding low volumes, the high demand for these beans commands a
          higher price. When roasted, Arabica beans become dark brown and have a smooth texture. They develop a diverse
          flavor profile that can range from slightly sweet and fruity to nutty. Due to its popularity and versatility,
          Arabica is an ideal choice for a wide range of coffee-based recipes, from freshly brewed coffee to coffee
          cakes.</div>
        <div class="flex_item"><span class="inner_text">Robusta:</span><br> Compared to Arabica, Robusta coffee is
          typically known for its harsh and acidic taste, along with its higher caffeine content. Robusta plants can
          thrive at lower elevations, in hotter climates, and with less moisture. As a result of its less stringent
          growing requirements and less favorable flavor, Robusta coffee usually commands a lower price than Arabica
          beans. Consequently, Robusta is the preferred choice for many mass-market commercial coffee products.</div>

      <h3>
        Roast Level
      </h3>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="roasts_item">
            <div class="front">Light Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Light roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a shorter amount of time, resulting in
              a light brown color and a light-bodied coffee. Due to the shorter roasting time, light roasts retain more
              of the original flavor of the coffee bean. Light roasts tend to have fruity or citrus notes and a higher
              acidity, along with higher caffeine content. They are an excellent choice if you want to emphasize the
              bean's original flavor in your recipes or brew a bright cup of coffee to start your day.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="roasts_item">
            <div class="front">Medium Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Medium roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a longer time than light roasts but
              not as long as dark roasts. They have a medium brown color and a medium-bodied coffee with a more balanced
              flavor profile. As roast temperature increases, the coffee beans begin to lose their acidity. Medium
              roasts are a common choice for brewed coffee due to their balanced flavor profiles, pairing well with
              beans of the Arabica and Excelsa varieties.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="roasts_item">
            <div class="front">Dark Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Dark roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a longer time at higher temperatures,
              resulting in a dark brown color and a full-bodied coffee with a robust flavor profile. Dark roasts are a
              great option for delivering intense, rich flavor to recipes, pairing well with beans of the Arabica
              variety. They are also a popular choice for brewed coffee like espresso or as an ingredient in baked
              goods, rubs and other recipes, making bitter beans like Robusta or Liberica more palatable. However, due
              to the longer roasting time, dark roasts have lower acidity and lower caffeine content compared to light
              and medium roasts.</div>
