            <div class="front">Light Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Light roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a shorter amount of time, resulting in
              a light brown color and a light-bodied coffee. Due to the shorter roasting time, light roasts retain more
              of the original flavor of the coffee bean. Light roasts tend to have fruity or citrus notes and a higher
              acidity, along with higher caffeine content. They are an excellent choice if you want to emphasize the
              bean's original flavor in your recipes or brew a bright cup of coffee to start your day.</div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="roasts_item">
            <div class="front">Medium Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Medium roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a longer time than light roasts but
              not as long as dark roasts. They have a medium brown color and a medium-bodied coffee with a more balanced
              flavor profile. As roast temperature increases, the coffee beans begin to lose their acidity. Medium
              roasts are a common choice for brewed coffee due to their balanced flavor profiles, pairing well with
              beans of the Arabica and Excelsa varieties.</div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="roasts_item">
            <div class="front">Dark Roasts</div>
            <div class="back">Dark roasts are coffee beans that are roasted for a longer time at higher temperatures,
              resulting in a dark brown color and a full-bodied coffee with a robust flavor profile. Dark roasts are a
              great option for delivering intense, rich flavor to recipes, pairing well with beans of the Arabica
              variety. They are also a popular choice for brewed coffee like espresso or as an ingredient in baked
              goods, rubs and other recipes, making bitter beans like Robusta or Liberica more palatable. However, due
              to the longer roasting time, dark roasts have lower acidity and lower caffeine content compared to light
              and medium roasts.</div>
